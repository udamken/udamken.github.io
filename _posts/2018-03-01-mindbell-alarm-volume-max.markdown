title:    (17) Why is alarm volume left on max?

Though hopefully fixed in version 2.5.9 there might be rare situations where MindBell leaves the alarm volume set to the max. Two situations are under suspicion:

* When opening volume settings of MindBell when the bell currently rings.
* When unloading or updating MindBell when the bell currently rings.

To avoid a rude awakening please check alarm volume before going to sleep or ...

**From version 3.2.5 on** you can choose which audio channel to use for sound output and whether to use your phone's volume control instead of MindBell's volume settings:

Please check the sound output section of the [settings](/mindbell-intro#settings).
