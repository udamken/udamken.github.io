title:    (12) Why does MindBell call it bell though it looks like a (singing) bowl?

You are right, the notification icon looks like a bowl and the picture shows a singing bowl, too.

In the tradition of Thich Nhat Hanh bell is meant more generic - a mindfulness bell can be the sound of a temple bell or a church bell or a tibetan bowl or it can even be a red traffic light. To read more about the bell of mindfulness in that tradition please read [this](http://plumvillage.org/mindfulness-practice/bell-of-mindfulness/).

And, as of this [article](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singing_bowl) singing bowls are a type of bell.

Therefore I decided to stick with the bell.

However, MindBell uses the term 'the bell rings' instead of saying 'to invite the bell' as it's usual within that tradition.
