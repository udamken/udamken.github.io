title:    (09) Why does MindBell ring irregular?
category: mindbell

MindBell per default does not ring on the minute and the interval varies around the specified average. This is to avoid preparing for the ring, to get surprised and be open minded.

However, since version 2.6.0 there is an option to ring on the minute and with regular intervals.
