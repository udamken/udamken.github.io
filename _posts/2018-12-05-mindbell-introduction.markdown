This is a short introduction following some screenshots.

## (1) Bell is inactive ##

Bell is inactive here - it can by activated by the switch:

![](https://github.com/udamken/mindbell/raw/master/misc/Screenshot_de_DE_01.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

If you tap the bell you should hear the sound of a singing bowl.

Adjust the [volume of the mindfulness bell](/mindbell-volume) either via the volume controls of your phone or in section _Reminder actions_ of the [settings](#settings). Which one is to be used depends on where the sound goes to, this can be modified in section _Sound output_ of the [settings](#settings)

## (2) Bell is active ##

This is how it looks after activating the bell with the switch:

![](https://github.com/udamken/mindbell/raw/master/misc/Screenshot_de_DE_02.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

To get the shown notication icon in the upper left corner you have to activate the status icon in the section _Status notification_ of the [settings](#settings).

On Android Oreo and higher the status notification icon is no longer available. You can use MindBell's quick settings tile instead. Please edit your quick settings as usual on your phone to get that tile. Tapping on the quick settings tile additionally allows to quickly suppress reminders for some hours - it's a shortcut to the menu entry _Don't remind for ..._.

Please take a look at the [settings](#settings) to tell MindBell when and how often to ring.

On older Android versions it might be that you cannot see the three dots button. Then you have to use the menu button to get to the menu.

## (3) Bell is muted ##

In the [settings](#settings) are several mute rules that define when to mute the bell. However, in the total-silence flavor of the do-not-disturb mode the bell is always muted. To show that the bell is muted the notification icon is **turned over** (from [open to the top](#bell-is-active) to upside down):

![](https://github.com/udamken/mindbell/raw/master/misc/Screenshot_de_DE_03.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

On Android Oreo and higher the status notification icon is no longer available. You can use MindBell's quick settings tile instead. Please edit your quick settings as usual on your phone to get that tile.

## (4) Meditation ##

Pressing the start medition buttons opens up the meditation dialog:

![](https://github.com/udamken/mindbell/raw/master/misc/Screenshot_de_DE_04.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

This lets you specify the time to prepare, the length of your meditation, the number (and length) of periods your meditation is cut into, whether you want to leave the screen on and whether MindBell should leave the meditation mode automatically after your meditation.

Choose only one period if you do not want to hear an intermediate bell sound during medition.

## (5) Start meditation ##

Pressing the start button starts the countdown of your ramp-up time:

![](https://github.com/udamken/mindbell/raw/master/misc/Screenshot_en_US_05.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}
![](https://github.com/udamken/mindbell/raw/master/misc/Screenshot_de_DE_05.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

The remaining seconds are shown in yellow - according to a traffic light: prepare to stop.

When this preparation period is over you hear the beginning bells and your meditation starts.

You can modifiy the number of sounds of a singing bowl at the beginning, in the middle, at the end and its volume in section _Meditation_ of the [settings](#settings).

## (6) Start meditation directly ##

Pressing the start-instantly button skips the ramp-up period shown in (5) and directly starts your meditation countdown:

![](https://github.com/udamken/mindbell/raw/master/misc/Screenshot_en_US_06.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}
![](https://github.com/udamken/mindbell/raw/master/misc/Screenshot_de_DE_06.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

The remaining minutes are shown in red (or orange) - according to a traffic light: stop moving.

## (7) Meditation is over ##

When the meditation is over the time beyond your meditation is counted up:

![](https://github.com/udamken/mindbell/raw/master/misc/Screenshot_en_US_07.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}
![](https://github.com/udamken/mindbell/raw/master/misc/Screenshot_de_DE_07.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

If you chose to leave meditation mode automatically counting up stops after playing the sound of the ending bells.

Otherwise counting up stops without leaving meditation mode after a while (to be precise: counting up takes as long as your meditation).

The surplus minutes are shown in green - according to a traffic light: feel free to move.

## (8) Settings ##

You can reach the settings by clicking on the gear-wheel or via the menu (see [here](#bell-is-active)):

![](https://github.com/udamken/mindbell/raw/master/misc/Screenshot_en_US_08.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}
![](https://github.com/udamken/mindbell/raw/master/misc/Screenshot_de_DE_08.png){:height="40%" width="40%"}

There are several sections containing different aspects to adjust MindBell to your needs.
