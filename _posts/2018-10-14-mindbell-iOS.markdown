title:    (10) Is there an iOS version of MindBell for my iPhone?

I'm sorry, but no, it isn't.

And due to the different development environments there probably won't be an iOS version in the future.

Furthermore I can't even recommend another mindfulness bell implementation because I'm not aware of a similar one. The only recommendation I can give is to search the internet for "mindfulness bell ios" and check it out.
