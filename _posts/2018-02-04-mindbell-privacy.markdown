MindBell respects your privacy.

MindBell does neither collect any personal information nor does it send any data to dknapps.de or third parties.

MindBell does not even request permissions to access the network or the internet.

If you decide to send an e-mail to dknapps.de with 'Send e-mail with log' under 'Problem solving' in MindBell's settings MindBell prepares the text of the e-mail for you. The generated e-mail text contains your version of MindBell and Android plus some device information and all log entries produced by MindBell to help finding a possible bug. However, it is fully up to you to review and send this prepared text with the e-mail app of your choice - MindBell does not send the e-mail on its own.
