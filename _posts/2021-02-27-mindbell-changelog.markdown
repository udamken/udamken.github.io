A few years ago I thankfully tookover the maintenance for this application from the original author.

In that times it had been a mindfulness bell "only" and I loved its simplicity and wonderful bell sound.

My idea was to create a complete mindfulness app, so I added a meditation timer, some preferences, support for Spanish (thanks to other contributors) and these help pages.

Everything worked fine in the beginning, then mobile vendors and new versions of Android started to optimize battery usage and things got difficult (see [power saving](/mindbell-notringing#power-saver) or this [accepted issue](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/122098785)). Furthermore Google frequently added policies and restrictions (in Android) that app developers have to adhere and consider.

Too make a long story short, I'm no longer to willing to spend my spare time on these things, it's to annoying.

However, I still like the idea of providing a mindfulness app without ads, internet connection and statistics - just a simple meditation timer (with large digits to be readable without glasses if you are guiding a meditation) plus a mindfulness bell.

So, if you are willing to become a maintainer of MindBell (despite the "risks" mentioned above), please don't hesitate to [contact me](https://dknapps.de/impressum/).
